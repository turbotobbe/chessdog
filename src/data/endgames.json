    "description": "Delivering checkmate with a king and queen against a lone king is quite easy. The basic technique involves driving the king to the edge of the board, which the queen can do by herself. It's faster if you use your king and queen together, but this increases the probability of a stalemate, so beginners should do it without the king. The technique described below will accomplish the mate in about 10 to 15 moves.",
